# Project Pac

The Project Pac is a cross-platform application. The main motive of this open-source application is to spread awareness and provide opportunities to contribute to open-source projects. The idea of the application is to allow students or any person who is interested in contributing to the open-source project can find projects nearby their location within a radius of 10 to 1000Km. As initially the candidates struggle in finding projects related to their tech stack in which they can contribute to, this solution will provide a way so that they can find projects of their interest and start contributing to it and gain some experience.

**Workflow of Application:-**

The interested candidate can apply filters to select the programming language and categories of projects of their choice in which they want to contribute. after applying the filters the candidate will get the list of projects which is available within the selected radius if in case the candidate could not find any project then the candidate can switch to a global section where he or she can find the project of their interest after selecting the project the candidate can approach the project author by sending a proposal. The format of the proposal will be provided by the project author in the given project description after the approval by the author the candidate will be added to that project and start contributing with the provided resource.
